            <h2>Fuzzy Wuzzy</h2>
            <p><span class="fw">Fuzzy Wuzzy</span> is one of the most popular tongue twisters. <br>
                The origins of this nursery rhyme aren’t clear but the term <br>
                “fuzzy wuzzy” was used to describe the Hadendoa warriors <br>
                in Sudan in a 1892 poem by Rudyard
                Kipling. <br>
                The nursery rhyme was first mentioned in a 1942 edition of “The Yorker” magazine with no reference to
                its origins. <br>

                The link between the Hadendoa warriors and the nursery rhyme is fuzzy, there is no definitive link
                between <br>
                the two but it is possible the rhyme refers to the bravery of the Hadendoa (hence they are a bear).

            <h2>Peter Piper </h2>
            <p> <span class="pp">Peter Piper</span> is one of the most popular tongue twister nursery rhymes original <br>
                 to England. Although it was known earlier as well, it was first 
                 <br>published in John Harris’s Peter Piper’s Practical Principles <br> 
                 of Plain and Perfect Pronunciation in 1813. Peter Piper may <br>
                  refer to a Mauritian government official called Peter Poivre, <br>
                who examined Seychelles’s potential for the cultivation of spices. </p>
